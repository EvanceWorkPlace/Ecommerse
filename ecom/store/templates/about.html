          <p class="text-muted fs-6" align="justify">
            At <strong>ElemComp</strong>, we believe that technology should be accessible to everyone — not just the newest gadgets but also high-quality used and refurbished products that still have incredible value. 
            Our platform is designed to make buying and selling electronics easier, safer, and more transparent for individuals and small businesses.
          </p>

          <p class="text-muted fs-6" align="justify">
            We started our journey as a small local electronics reseller, helping communities repurpose old devices while reducing electronic waste. 
            Over time, we realized that many people were searching for a trusted place online to find affordable components, IoT devices, and reliable second-hand electronics. 
            That’s when <strong>ElemComp</strong> evolved into a full online marketplace — where customers can explore, compare, and purchase verified products from anywhere.
          </p>

          <p class="text-muted fs-6" align="justify">
